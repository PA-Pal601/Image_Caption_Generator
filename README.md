# Image_Caption_Generator

The Image Caption Generator is a Deep Learning-based system designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. This project integrates techniques from Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using an Encoder–Decoder architecture.
The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract visual features from images and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate coherent textual descriptions.


Objectives

To develop an automated image-to-text generation system

To implement an Encoder–Decoder deep learning architecture

To combine CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence modeling

To evaluate caption quality on standard datasets
